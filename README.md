# Spring-Boot-Admin-Server

A Spring Boot Admin Server and Admin Client are components of a monitoring and management system for Spring Boot applications. They enable administrators to monitor and manage multiple Spring Boot applications from a centralized dashboard.

Spring Boot Admin Server:

The Spring Boot Admin Server is a web application that provides a user interface for monitoring and managing Spring Boot applications.
It acts as a centralized server that collects and displays information about registered Spring Boot applications.
The server communicates with the admin clients to obtain data such as application health, metrics, logging, and configuration details.
It provides features like application status monitoring, health checks, environment configuration management, logging management, thread and memory utilization monitoring, etc.
The server usually runs as a standalone Spring Boot application.
Spring Boot Admin Client:

The Spring Boot Admin Client is a library that needs to be included in the Spring Boot applications that you want to monitor and manage.
It allows the Spring Boot applications to register themselves with the Spring Boot Admin Server.
The client library collects and sends application-specific data to the server periodically, allowing the server to display real-time information about the applications.
The client library provides an API to expose information such as application health, metrics, logging, and configuration details to the server.
It also allows the server to send management commands to the client applications, enabling features like restarting an application, changing log levels, etc.
